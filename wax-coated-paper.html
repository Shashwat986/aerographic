                Wax Coated Paper was invented to develop a recyclable waxed paper product. The major problems faced by packaging industries are the environmental concern. It is resulting in serious problems of food and food packaging waste disposal.

                Wax coated paper is largely used to maintain the creamy taste toffees and chocolates. Waxed paper can not be recycled because wax particles cannot be separated from the paper fiber during pulping.
